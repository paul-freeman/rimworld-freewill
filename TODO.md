# Testing Plan for Priority.cs

## ✅ COMPLETED: Enable Full Test Execution (Priority: CRITICAL) - **COMPLETED June 19, 2025**
**Status**: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED  
**Achievement**: Tests can now run outside RimWorld with Testing configuration that conditionally copies RimWorld DLLs

### Problem Statement
Currently, our comprehensive test suite (18 tests, 17 failing due to assembly loading) cannot execute in development environment because RimWorld DLLs are not copied to test output directory. The `<Private>False</Private>` setting is correct for production but prevents development testing.

### Solution: Conditional DLL Copying for Testing
**Approach**: Modify test project to conditionally copy RimWorld DLLs based on build configuration

### Implementation Steps: ✅ ALL COMPLETED
- [x] **Step A**: Create new "Testing" build configuration for test project ✅
- [x] **Step B**: Add MSBuild targets to copy RimWorld DLLs only in Testing configuration ✅ 
- [x] **Step C**: Modify test project references to use `<Private>True</Private>` only in Testing mode ✅
- [x] **Step D**: Add .gitignore entries for copied DLLs in test output directory ✅
- [x] **Step E**: Update build/test documentation with new Testing configuration ✅
- [x] **Step F**: Verify all 18 tests execute successfully with copied DLLs ✅
- [x] **Step G**: Add cleanup task to remove copied DLLs when switching back to Debug/Release ✅

### Detailed Technical Implementation Plan

#### Step A: Create Testing Build Configuration
Add new `Testing` configuration to `FreeWill.Tests.csproj`:
```xml
<PropertyGroup Condition=" '$(Configuration)|$(Platform)' == 'Testing|AnyCPU' ">
    <DebugSymbols>true</DebugSymbols>
    <DebugType>full</DebugType>
    <Optimize>false</Optimize>
    <OutputPath>bin\Testing\</OutputPath>
    <DefineConstants>DEBUG;TRACE;TESTING</DefineConstants>
    <ErrorReport>prompt</ErrorReport>
    <WarningLevel>4</WarningLevel>
    <CopyRimWorldDLLs>true</CopyRimWorldDLLs>
</PropertyGroup>
```

#### Step B: Add Conditional DLL References
Modify existing `<Reference>` elements to use conditional `Private` attribute:
```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <Reference Include="Assembly-CSharp">
    <HintPath>$(RimWorldManaged)\Assembly-CSharp.dll</HintPath>
    <Private Condition="'$(Configuration)' == 'Testing'">True</Private>
    <Private Condition="'$(Configuration)' != 'Testing'">False</Private>
  </Reference>
  <!-- Apply same pattern to all RimWorld DLL references -->
</ItemGroup>
```

#### Step C: Add MSBuild Verification Target
Add target to verify DLLs are copied correctly:
```xml
<Target Name="VerifyRimWorldDLLs" AfterTargets="Build" Condition="'$(Configuration)' == 'Testing'">
  <Message Text="RimWorld DLLs copied to: $(OutputPath)" Importance="high" />
  <Message Text="Assembly-CSharp.dll exists: $([System.IO.File]::Exists('$(OutputPath)Assembly-CSharp.dll'))" Importance="high" />
</Target>
```

#### Step D: Update .gitignore
Add entries to prevent committing copied DLLs:
```gitignore
# Testing configuration DLL copies
FreeWill.Tests/bin/Testing/
**/bin/Testing/Assembly-CSharp.dll
**/bin/Testing/UnityEngine*.dll
**/bin/Testing/0Harmony.dll
```

#### Step E: Create Build Scripts
Create `build-and-test.ps1` PowerShell script:
```powershell
# Build in Testing configuration and run tests
dotnet build --configuration Testing FreeWill.Tests/FreeWill.Tests.csproj
if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
    FreeWill.Tests/bin/Testing/FreeWill.Tests.exe
}
```

#### Step F: Validation Steps
1. Run `dotnet build --configuration Testing` - should copy DLLs
2. Run `dotnet build --configuration Debug` - should NOT copy DLLs
3. Execute `FreeWill.Tests/bin/Testing/FreeWill.Tests.exe` - all 18 tests should pass
4. Verify mod still loads correctly in RimWorld (no impact on production)

**File Size Impact**: Testing build will be ~50-100MB larger due to copied DLLs, but Debug/Release remain unchanged.

### Technical Implementation Details:
```xml
<!-- In FreeWill.Tests.csproj -->
<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)' == 'Testing'">
  <CopyRimWorldDLLs>true</CopyRimWorldDLLs>
</PropertyGroup>

<ItemGroup>
  <Reference Include="Assembly-CSharp">
    <HintPath>$(RimWorldManaged)\Assembly-CSharp.dll</HintPath>
    <Private Condition="'$(CopyRimWorldDLLs)' == 'true'">True</Private>
    <Private Condition="'$(CopyRimWorldDLLs)' != 'true'">False</Private>
  </Reference>
  <!-- Repeat for other RimWorld DLLs -->
</ItemGroup>
```

### Benefits:
- ✅ Enables full test suite execution during development
- ✅ Maintains correct production mod structure (`Private=False`)  
- ✅ Allows CI/CD pipeline testing
- ✅ Provides rapid feedback loop for test-driven development
- ✅ No impact on mod distribution (DLLs not included in mod package)

### Acceptance Criteria: ✅ ALL MET
- [x] `dotnet test --configuration Testing` runs all tests successfully ✅
- [x] `dotnet build --configuration Debug/Release` maintains `Private=False` behavior ✅
- [x] Test output directory contains RimWorld DLLs only in Testing configuration ✅
- [x] All 18 existing tests pass when executed with copied DLLs ✅
- [x] Build size remains minimal for Debug/Release configurations ✅

**COMPLETION STATUS**: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED (June 19, 2025)  
**IMPACT**: High - Testing workflow now fully enabled  
**VERIFICATION**: All tests now execute successfully with exit code 0

### Implementation Summary:
1. **New Testing Configuration**: Added `Testing|AnyCPU` build configuration to FreeWill.Tests.csproj
2. **Conditional DLL Copying**: Modified all RimWorld DLL references to use `<Private>True</Private>` only in Testing configuration
3. **MSBuild Verification**: Added build target that confirms DLLs are copied correctly
4. **Git Ignore Updates**: Added entries to prevent committing 60+ copied RimWorld DLLs
5. **Build Scripts**: Created PowerShell (.ps1) and Batch (.bat) scripts for automated build and test execution
6. **Full Validation**: Confirmed Testing config copies all DLLs (~50-100MB) while Debug/Release remain minimal

## 🎉 STEP 2 COMPLETION STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED
**Date Completed**: June 19, 2025  
**Major Milestone**: Core Priority Calculation Tests are now fully implemented and comprehensive

**What was accomplished in Step 2:**
- ✅ Complete test coverage for all core Priority class methods (ToGamePriority, FromGamePriority, constructor, IComparable)
- ✅ Comprehensive testing of priority adjustment methods (Set, Add, Multiply) with reflection-based access
- ✅ Full testing of flag management methods (AlwaysDo, NeverDo, AlwaysDoIf, NeverDoIf) 
- ✅ Extensive boundary value and edge case testing for all conversion methods
- ✅ Error handling tests for invalid inputs and null references
- ✅ Round-trip conversion testing to ensure consistency
- ✅ Disabled flag behavior testing and interaction with other methods
- ✅ Test infrastructure that gracefully handles RimWorld dependencies

**Technical Achievement**: The Priority class core functionality now has robust test coverage that serves as both regression protection and documentation of expected behavior.

## Overview
This TODO outlines the plan to add comprehensive unit tests for the `Priority.cs` file, which contains the core logic for calculating work priorities for pawns in the FreeWill mod. The `Priority` class is complex with ~2500 lines of code and contains numerous methods that calculate priority adjustments based on various game factors.

## Priority: HIGH
Adding tests for this core component is critical for:
- Ensuring priority calculations remain correct during future modifications
- Catching regressions when game mechanics change
- Documenting expected behavior of the complex priority calculation logic
- Improving maintainability of this large, complex class

## Technical Debt Analysis
The `Priority.cs` file shows several areas of technical debt that should be addressed:
1. **Large class with many responsibilities** - The class handles over 20 different work types with distinct logic
2. **Long switch statement** - The `InnerCompute()` method has a massive switch with repetitive code patterns
3. **Exception handling** - Many methods have similar try-catch blocks that could be abstracted
4. **Magic numbers** - Various hardcoded constants throughout (e.g., `DISABLED_CUTOFF = 100 / (Pawn_WorkSettings.LowestPriority + 1)`)
5. **Method complexity** - Some methods like `ConsiderBestAtDoing()` are very complex and hard to test

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Setup Test Infrastructure (Priority: HIGH)
**Location**: Create new test project structure
- [x] Create `FreeWill.Tests` project with MSTest/NUnit framework
- [x] Add necessary RimWorld references for testing
- [x] Create mock objects/test data for `Pawn`, `WorkTypeDef`, etc.
- [x] Setup test data builders for common scenarios
- [x] **Update tests to use full RimWorld DLLs** - Ensure test project has access to complete RimWorld assemblies as defined in Directory.Build.props to enable comprehensive testing without limitations

**COMPLETED**: Basic test infrastructure has been established. Created `FreeWill.Tests` project with:
- Basic project structure targeting .NET Framework 4.7.2 (matching RimWorld requirements)
- RimWorld assembly references (Assembly-CSharp, UnityEngine, etc.)
- Test helper classes for creating mock game objects and test data
- Simplified initial tests that compile and can verify basic functionality
- Note: Full MSTest integration is prepared but simplified for initial setup
- **UPDATED**: Test project now has access to complete RimWorld assemblies including 0Harmony, UnityEngine.IMGUIModule, and UnityEngine.TextRenderingModule, matching the main project's references for comprehensive testing capabilities

**TECHNICAL NOTES**: Due to RimWorld's sealed classes and complex game state dependencies, the testing approach uses:
- Simple test helper classes instead of complex mocking frameworks initially
- Basic test methods that can be run manually to verify functionality
- Foundation for expanding to full MSTest framework once core functionality is verified
- Full RimWorld DLL access enables testing of Harmony patches and Unity-dependent code paths

### 2. Core Priority Calculation Tests (Priority: HIGH) - **COMPLETED**
**Location**: `Priority.cs` - Core methods
- [x] Test `Priority` constructor with various inputs

- [x] Test edge cases for both conversion methods
- [x] Test priority adjustment helper methods (Set, Add via reflection)
- [x] Test `Compute()` method for successful calculations with valid game state
- [x] Test `Multiply()` method with various multipliers
- [x] Test `AlwaysDo()` and `AlwaysDoIf()` methods
- [x] Test `NeverDo()` and `NeverDoIf()` methods
- [x] Test behavior when `Disabled` flag is set

**COMPLETED**: All core priority calculation methods have been thoroughly tested!
- Constructor tests verify basic property initialization and null handling
- Conversion methods (ToGamePriority/FromGamePriority) tested with boundary values, edge cases, and round-trip consistency

- Flag methods (AlwaysDo, NeverDo, AlwaysDoIf, NeverDoIf) tested for state management
- Error handling thoroughly tested for invalid inputs and null references
- Disabled flag behavior tested for interaction with other methods
- Tests handle RimWorld dependencies gracefully with appropriate error handling

**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES**:
- Tests use reflection to access private methods (Set, Add, Multiply, etc.) for comprehensive coverage
- Boundary value testing ensures conversion methods handle edge cases properly
- State management testing verifies Enabled/Disabled flag interactions
- Tests are designed to work both in development environment and within RimWorld

## Dependencies and Considerations

### RimWorld Testing Challenges
- RimWorld types are not easily mockable (sealed classes, static dependencies)
- Game state dependencies make isolated unit testing difficult
- May need to use integration tests for some scenarios
- Consider using Moq or similar mocking framework where possible

### Test Execution Environment
- Tests will need RimWorld assemblies available
- May require specific .NET Framework version (4.7.2)
- Consider running tests in isolated AppDomain to avoid state pollution

### Maintenance Considerations
- Tests should be resilient to RimWorld version updates
- Mock objects should be kept in sync with actual RimWorld API changes
- Consider creating a test suite that can run against different RimWorld versions
