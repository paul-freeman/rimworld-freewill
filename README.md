# Free Will

Colonists have free will! Adds a precept that influences how willing colonists
are to do what they're told.

The project assumes RimWorld is installed in
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\RimWorld`. Set the
`RIMWORLD_DIR` environment variable to point to a different installation
directory before building.

## Tests

This repository contains a small xUnit test project located in the `tests` directory. After installing the .NET SDK, run tests with:

```bash
dotnet test
```

The included example test verifies that the test infrastructure is working.
