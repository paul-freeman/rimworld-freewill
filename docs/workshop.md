# Steam Workshop Description

`description.txt` contains the entire text shown on the mod's Steam Workshop page. It mirrors the README so players who install from Steam can see the full feature list and tips.

When publishing a new release:

1. Update `description.txt` with any changes or new features.
2. Commit the updated file as part of the release pull request.
3. After the release is published, copy the contents of `description.txt` into the Steam Workshop item description so the page matches the repository.

Keeping the file in version control ensures the Workshop page stays in sync with each tagged release.
